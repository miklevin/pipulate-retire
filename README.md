## Let's Get Pipulating!

Pipulate is a full running Linux server on your Windows 10 or 11 computer,
using this <a href="http://mikelev.in/ux/">Drink Me</a> install script. It
gives you JupyterLab on localhost:8888 that will feel like it's on Windows, but
is really setting you up to transition over into the world of Linux automation.

### Folders Full of Examples

After installing Pipulate you will find JupyterLab running in your browser at
localhost:8888 and a pipulate and practice folder.
